# Asset Management for Blender

With <font size="+1"><strong>Asset Management</strong></font>, you can manage 
your libraries and add assets 
directly in Blender.

### All your Assets in one place !

Asset Management has a folder browser that allows you to navigate 
create, move or delete an asset category as easily as a regular folder browser.
